# RetroDocs
Quantam's collection of retro game documents.

At present I only plan to keep documents I've written here, though it's possible I might change my mind and start putting useful documents I find by other people here as well. But if I do I will probably put them in a separate folder to make it clear they're not my own work.

I'm not 100% sure how copyright works on this sort of thing yet, but to the extent possible (i.e. my own text, excluding tables directly extracted from copyrighted games) consider my works licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Any errors or suggested changes to existing documents can go in Issues.
